# 🏨 Hotel Reservations Cancellation Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict hotel reservation cancellations using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various booking-related features, we can help hotels reduce financial losses due to cancellations and optimize their booking strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains details about hotel bookings, including:
- 👥 Guest information (number of adults, children, and special requests)
- 📅 Booking details (lead time, arrival date, length of stay)
- 💰 Pricing and amenities (meal type, parking requirement, room price)
- 🔄 Previous booking history (cancellations, repeat guests)
- 🌍 Market segment and booking status

### 🔑 Key Columns:
- **🆔 Booking_ID**: Unique identifier for each booking
- **⏳ lead_time**: Number of days between booking and arrival
- **📡 market_segment**: Channel through which the booking was made
- **❌ no_previous_cancellations**: Previous cancellations by the customer
- **💵 avg_price_per_room**: Price per night (in Euros)
- **✅ booking_status**: Whether the booking was canceled or confirmed (target variable)

## 🔄 Implementation Steps
1. **🛠 Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and data inconsistencies
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical formats
   - Normalize numerical features

2. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identify patterns in cancellations
   - Visualize trends using graphs and charts

3. **⚡ Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features for better predictions
   - Identify most influential factors

4. **🤖 Model Selection & Training**
   - Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5. **🔮 Prediction & Insights**
   - Use the best-performing model to predict cancellations
   - Provide insights for hotel management

## 📚 Libraries Used
### 📂 Data Handling & Manipulation:
- **🐼 Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation.
- **🔢 NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and handling arrays efficiently.

### 📊 Data Visualization:
- **📉 Matplotlib**: Used to create static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
