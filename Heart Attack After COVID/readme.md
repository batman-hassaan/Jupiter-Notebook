# ❤️‍🔥 Heart Attack Analysis & Visualization

This project provides an in-depth analysis and visualization of a real-world healthcare dataset that focuses on the relationship between vaccination, pre-existing health conditions, and heart attack occurrences among patients across India.

## 📋 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 76 entries and covers the following fields:

- 🆔 Patient ID  
- 🎂 Age  
- 🚻 Gender  
- 💉 Vaccination Date  
- 💊 Vaccine Dose  
- 🏥 Pre-existing Conditions  
- 💔 Heart Attack Date  
- 📶 Severity  
- 🩺 Outcome  
- 📍 Location  
- 🔴 Blood Pressure  
- 🧪 Cholesterol Level  
- ⚖️ BMI  
- 🚬 Smoking History  
- 🍭 Diabetes Status  

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- 🐼 `pandas`: Data loading and preprocessing  
- 🔢 `numpy`: Numerical operations  
- 📊 `matplotlib`: Basic plotting  
- 📈 `seaborn`: Advanced visualizations  
- 🌐 `plotly.express`: Interactive visualizations  

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- � Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- 🧠 Analyze correlations between:
  - Pre-existing conditions (Diabetes/Obesity/Heart Disease)  
  - Vaccination status (1st/2nd Dose/Booster)  
  - Lifestyle factors (Smoking/BMI/Blood Pressure/Cholesterol)  
- 📉 Visualize severity and outcomes  
- ⚖️ Compare survival rates by gender/age/location  

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- 🔥 Correlation Heatmaps  
- 📊 Condition Frequency Bar Charts  
- 🥧 Survival Outcome Pie Charts  
- 📈 Temporal Trend Line Graphs  
- ⚛️ BMI-Cholesterol-Severity Scatter Plots  
- 🗺️ Geographical Distribution Maps  

## 🚀 How to Run

- ▶️ Execute all cells

# 📁 File Structure
Copy
heart_attack_analysis/
├── heart_attat.ipynb       # Complete analysis notebook
├── README.md               # Project documentation

# 💡 Key Insights
- 📈 Major Risk Factors: High BMI, BP, and cholesterol

- 🚬 High-Risk Groups: Diabetics, obese individuals, smokers

- 💉 Vaccination Note: 2nd dose frequency observed (correlation ≠ causation)

- ✅ Positive Note: High survival rates with early intervention

- 🗺️ Regional Hotspots: Kolkata, Jaipur, Surat, Indore

# 📌 Future Enhancements
- 🧠 ML models for risk prediction

- 🔗 Integrate activity/stress/sleep data

- 📊 Interactive dashboard (Dash/Streamlit)
